# react-native-template
A simple starting template for React Native mobile applications. I frequently use this to get apps up and running immediately.

## How to Use
If you need a simple set-up to quickly get a prototype off the ground, this might be helpful. The template is an app with a tab bar and the accompanying routing already built-in.  To use, just clone and modify the views accompanying each tab.
